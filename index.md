# Human-Computer Interaction

Aging and Accessibility | Dementia and Cognitive Diversity | Social Computing | Financial Technology

My research in HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION (HCI) explores how technology can be designed for underrepresented user groups, including older adults and those with complex communication needs, to overcome everyday challenges and improve quality of life.

## Selected Projects

Supporting older adults in online banking

Enriching social sharing for the dementia community

Promoting eHealth literacy
